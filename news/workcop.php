                As part of the Gender Action Plan (GAP) under the HETI UNILA project, the University of Lampung held a Gender and Anti-Violence Workshop for project implementers at the State Higher Education Hospital and Integrated Research Center.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the workshop aimed to enhance participants’ understanding of gender equality and promote a zero-tolerance approach to violence in all aspects of project implementation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                The session covered fundamental gender concepts, types of gender-based violence, and institutional mechanisms for prevention and response, especially within the context of infrastructure and service development.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                “We aim to ensure that all project staff recognize the importance of gender integration and a violence-free workplace as key elements of successful project delivery,” said [insert speaker’s name, if any].
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                This workshop marked an important step in cultivating a work culture that is inclusive, respectful, and gender-sensitive across the University of Lampung’s project ecosystem.
